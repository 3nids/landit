**Land It** is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to calculate elevations from a raster DTM and save them in a layer.

The plugin will loop through a layer of points, calculate their elevation using a raster DTM and save them in the chosen field.
You can limit to a selection or process only currently NULL values.
