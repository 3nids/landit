Simple filter on the vector layer may be applied (browse only currently NULL values and/or only selected features).\r\n\r\nIt can be used to calculate elevation from a DTM.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Interpolation: nearest neighbot, linear or bicubic* interpolation\r\n* Process can be limited to a selection or to yet undefined values\r\n* Choose band to process in the raster\r\n\r\n*[scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) is required\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/3nids/rasterinterpolation/master/doc/screenshot.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
